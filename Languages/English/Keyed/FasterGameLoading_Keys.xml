    <!-- Settings -->
    <FGL_EarlyModContentLoading>Load mod content early during game idling periods. When enabled, the game might become unresponsive during loading, but it's expected. Disable this if you encounter any issues.</FGL_EarlyModContentLoading>
    <FGL_DelayGraphicLoading>Delay graphic and icon loading to game runtime (ADVANCED). This can speed up initial loading, but may cause temporary texture issues. The delayed loading is now optimized for better performance. Only enable if you have many high-resolution texture mods and understand the trade-offs.</FGL_DelayGraphicLoading>
    <FGL_DisableStaticAtlasesBaking>Disable static texture atlas baking (ADVANCED). This can slightly speed up initial loading, but will reduce in-game rendering performance (lower TPS). The atlas system is now optimized to work better with delayed loading. Not recommended unless you experience specific issues.</FGL_DisableStaticAtlasesBaking>

    <!-- Texture Resizing -->
    <FGL_TextureResizingExplanation>Some mods may contain a lot of high-res textures that take a long time to load. Use this to downscale hi-res textures. 
        Additionally, dds files generated by RimPy will be deleted alongside, so you can perform texture compression by this tool again. \n
        Following textures will be reduced down to target size: \n
        Building - 256px\n
        Pawn - 256px\n
        Apparel - 128px \n
        Weapon - 128px\n
        Item - 128px\n
        Plant - 128px\n
        Tree - 256px\n
        Terrain - 1024px</FGL_TextureResizingExplanation>
    <FGL_DownscaleTextures>Downscale textures</FGL_DownscaleTextures>
    <FGL_TextureResizingConfirmation>Perform texture downscaling? It can be reverted by redownloading mods.</FGL_TextureResizingConfirmation>
